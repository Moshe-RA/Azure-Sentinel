# Executive Summary

Configure Sentinel and load custom playbooks to have Illusive open Sentinel incidents, populate them with Illusive-based information, and automate incident response.
This document provides detailed instructions for setting, running, and using the Illusive Active Defense solution.
   <br>
   <b>Incident Enrichment – </b>leverages Sentinel analytic rules to discover Illusive-based alerts and report the associated data and forensics as Sentinel incident sets. 
Use this playbook to enrich Sentinel security incidents originating from Illusive with Illusive incident and forensics information. Illusive continues to enrich relevant Sentinel incidents as new events are detected. This is done using the Illusive API resource.   
   <br>
<b>Incident Response – </b>leverages CrowdStrike or Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration to automate incident response when specified Illusive incidents are discovered. 
Use the playbook to quickly stop or slow down ransomware attacks and critical incidents detected by Illusive in your organization. Upon detection, Sentinel is instructed to use the triggering process information reported by Illusive remove or kill the process. If the triggering process cannot be killed, Sentinel is instructed to isolate the host. These capabilities are available for organizations with CrowdStrike Falcon or Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.   
   <br>
<b>Analytic Rule –</b> Trigger a Sentinel alert upon detecting an Illusive event and create a Sentinel incident. The Sentinel incident will correspond to the Illusive incident and will include all subsequent associated Illusive events.
